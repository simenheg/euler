# It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an

# By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

# 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4

# The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth
# expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in

# In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a
